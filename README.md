###Basic Plotly.js Tutorial

This tutorial covers the very basics of using plotly.js for producing plots. In order to run the HTML locally, you will need a local HTTP server. I recommend using the one that comes with python 3.7 and above, http.server.

You will need to navigate to the folder containing the tutorial. The command-line command for running this HTTP server on your local machine is:

python-m http.server

Once started with the above command, you will need to open a browser to http://www.0.0.0.0:8000/test.html.

In addition to linking to the test.js javascript file, the HTML file links to the minified CDN of plotly.js on the plotly.org website. This will be enough to display a basic graph.
